Dancer2::Plugin::Syntax::GetPost - Syntactic sugar for GET+POST handlers

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Dancer2::Plugin::Syntax::GetPost;

  get_post '/myform' => sub { ... };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides very simple syntactic sugar to define a handler for GET and
POST requests.  Instead of writing this:

  any [qw/get post/] => '/form' => sub { ... };

You can write just this:

  get_post '/form' => sub { ... };
